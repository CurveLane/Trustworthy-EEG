### 1. EEG + Trustworthy Papers

These papers combine EEG-related tasks with trustworthy AI methods, including Dongrui Wu's work and others. They are categorized by their function:

---

### 1.1 Privacy

- **Identity Protection**  
  - **User Identity Protection in EEG-Based Brain–Computer Interfaces**  
    *Description*: Uses error-minimizing perturbation to remove user identity while maintaining task accuracy.

---

### 1.2 Security

- **Adversarial Attacks**  
  - **FGSM**
    - **On the Vulnerability of CNN Classifiers in EEG-Based BCIs**  
      *Description*: Explores White/Grey/Black box attacks using unsupervised FGSM. This is an early work by Dongrui Wu and his students.
  - **CW Attack**
    - **White-Box Target Attack for EEG-Based BCI Regression Problems**  
      *Description*: Utilizes modified CW and FGSM methods for white-box attacking regression models like Ridge regression and MLP.
  - **DeepFool**
    - **Universal Adversarial Perturbations for CNN Classifiers in EEG-Based BCIs**  
      *Description*: Uses DeepFool-modified method to create real-time adversarial perturbations for EEG-based CNN classifiers.
  - **Poisoning Attack & Backdoor**
    - **EEG-Based Brain–Computer Interfaces are Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks**  
      *Description*: Proposes using narrow period pulse for poisoning attacks to create backdoors in EEG-based BCI models. The backdoor key does not need to be synchronized with the EEG trials, making it easy to implement.

### 1.3 Review Papers

- **Systematic Review**  
  - **Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Physiological Computing: A Systematic Review**  
    *Description*: A comprehensive review of adversarial attacks and defenses in physiological computing, focusing on EEG and other physiological signals.
